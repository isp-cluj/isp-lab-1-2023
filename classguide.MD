    - On macOS/Linux: Use Terminal.

2. **Navigate to Your ISP Folder**
    - Choose a location on your computer where you want to store your ISP classwork.
    - Run the following command to navigate to that location:
      ```sh
      cd /path/to/your/ISP-folder
      ```

      ```
    - This will create a local copy of your GitHub repository.
